# azure-secure-rdp-architecture
Implemented DNAT rules, UDR, NSG, and internal load balancing to protect VMs from public exposure while enabling RDP through Azure Firewall.

Project Summary:
Designed and implemented a secure Azure network architecture to enable Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) access to virtual machines without exposing any public IPs.
The solution is based upon Azure Firewall, Internal Load Balancer, Network Security Groups (NSGs), and User Defined Routes (UDRs) to ensure centralized control, visibility, and protection for inbound and outbound traffic.
